## Theme goals
- Use a simple pallete and have better contrast and hierarchies using color without the need of borders.
- Achieve a more modern and clean design with the chosen pallete and things like rounded corners in certain elements like the windows, borders, buttons and controls.
- Improve the user experience with small animations in certain parts.
- Change the aesthetic without affecting functionality.
- Polish certain parts of the UI to give a better user experience.
- Different aesthetic of other available themes available by default in Playnite and created by the community.
